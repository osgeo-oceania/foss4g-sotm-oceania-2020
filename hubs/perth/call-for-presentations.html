    <h2 id="cfp">Call for presentations</h2>
    <h3>Open now, until 22 October!</h3>
    <p>We're inviting the WA open geospatial, open data, and mapping community to submit presentations for the upcoming FOSS4G & State of the Map event in Perth. Details are below, with a link to submit your presentation.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="what">What we're looking for</h2>
    <p>We'll have two different types of presentations: full-length talks (15 minutes), and lightning talks (5 minutes).</p>
    <p>We want to hear what's happening in open source geospatial, open data, and OpenStreetMap. What are you working on? What's the state of your art? Do you have a success (or failure!) story? Are you developing something new that you want to share, or do you have an interesting perspective on the state of our community?</p>
    <p>We want a variety of content from a diverse array of speakers. We're open-minded about what this looks like, but to help get the juices flowing, here are some general themes we'd expect to see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Case studies from your organisation or community</li>
        <li>Use of open source tools & open data, or new tools you're developing</li>
        <li>Community building projects, or your perspective on our community</li>
        <li>Your spectacular successes (or formidable failures)</li>
        <li>Challenges you're facing or that you see the community facing</li>
        <li>Whatever's on your mind! This is your conference...</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Everything geospatial:</strong> Think anything ‘geo’ related! From hardcore GIS, cartography, geology, geoscience, and remote sensing to historical maps, psychogeography, geocaching, and general mapping nerdery. Any area, project, or challenge where knowing the geo context is key!</p>
    <p><strong>Open source geospatial:</strong> Think QGIS, PostGIS, Leaflet, OpenLayers, Python, R, GeoServer, MapServer, and the usual suspects, but also, think outside that box. What's the future?</p>
    <p><strong>OpenStreetMap & open data:</strong> What are you building, what are you using, and what are the obstacles in obtaining, using or opening up your data?</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="who">Who should submit</h2>
    <p>You may be an experienced presenter, or perhaps this is the first time you've ever even considered presenting at a conference. If you have a relevant story to tell, we want to hear from you.</p>
    <p>We would love to have a diverse array of speakers, with strong representation across genders, different cultural backgrounds, young & old, and urban & rural. We can only do this if we get the submissions, so please, be brave and do it!</p>
    <p>We're here to help you deliver a great presentation. If this is new to you, we can connect you with an experienced speaker to help prepare your submission, or review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. We're happy to brainstorm with you on possible topics, or talk about your idea. Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:perth-hub@foss4g-oceania.org">perth-hub@foss4g-oceania.org</a>.</p>
