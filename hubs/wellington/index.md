# Overview


We are excited to present the 2020 FOSS4G SotM Conference Wellington Hub, hosted by NIWA, Evans Bay on Friday 20 Nov.

With COVID-19 restricting travel, this years FOSS4G-SotM conference is a combined online & physical event. Hubs held around the region will host a mix of shared online content and local presentations. There will be opportunities to meet local OSGeo community attendees and hear from a range of speakers.

- what to expect at the conference - presentations of local success stories, web mapping, GIS, spatial data management, metadata

- venue information - The main conference room at NIWA, Wellington. This will comfortably seet 40 people, theatre style

Who’ll be there?

This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers, academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap project.

This is your chance to connect with and hear from developers creating the next generation of geospatial technology. Get ahead of the curve and find out what’s on the horizon. FOSS4G and State of the Map events attract a very diverse audience on the global stage – so strap in for amazing content.

We’re monitoring the COVID situation closely and will make sure the conference is a safe and clean space in line with the latest guidance.

The number of tickets is limited by the size of the room and social-distancing guidelines.
