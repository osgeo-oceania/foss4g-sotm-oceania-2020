<h4>Tom MacWright</h4>

<p><b>Title:</b> Ethics in Geo</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> From the Mercator projection to Google Earth, geospatial 
technology has always had an ethical component and a close relationship 
with military and industrial forces. I'll replay the last few decades 
of development in this world, try to figure out where we are and what 
we can do about it.</p>
<p><b>Biography:</b> Tom MacWright spent over a decade in the space of geospatial 
and visualization technology, leading projects at Development Seed, Mapbox, 
and Observable. He's a frequent writer and contributor to open source projects.</p>

<h4>Grayson Cooke</h4>
<img src="/img/bios/GraysonCooke.jpg" style="width:auto; height:auto">
<p><b>Title:</b> New Uses for Invalid Data: Satellite Imaging and “Path 99”</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> “Path 99” is an art-science project designed for fulldome 
  planetarium projection. Produced by media artist Grayson Cooke and sound 
  artist Dugal McKinnon, and underpinned by a collaboration with Geoscience 
  Australia and the Digital Earth Australia platform, this project uses 
  satellite images of clouds to explore the weather and landscape of Path 99, 
  an orbit of the Landsat 8 satellite that passes directly down the centre of 
  Australia. In this talk I will provide an “open desktop” outline of the 
  project, focusing on how the project merges GIS applications and processes 
  with artistic and conceptual enquiry.</p>
<p><b>Biography:</b> Born in New Zealand and based in Australia, Grayson Cooke 
  is an interdisciplinary scholar and media artist, Associate Professor of 
  Media at Southern Cross University. Grayson has exhibited and performed at 
  major galleries and festivals internationally including the Japan Media Arts 
  Festival, WRO Media Art Biennale and Imagine Science Film Festival in New 
  York, and he has published widely in academic journals. He holds an 
  interdisciplinary PhD from Concordia University in Montreal.</p>

  <h4>Lesley Arnold</h4>

  <p><b>Title:</b> FireWater: A Collaboration between Open Source, government, 
    academia, business, non-for-profit and geospatial communities</p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b> In the summer of 2019/20, destructive bushfires ripped 
    through New South Wales, eastern and north-eastern Victoria, and Kangaroo 
    Island in South Australia – burning over 1.8 million hectares of land and 
    causing loss of life and wildlife.  During bushfires, firefighters often 
    have difficulty sourcing water. In some regional locations, mains water may 
    not be accessible and firefighters must rely on the static water infrastructure
     - swimming pools, tanks and dams - as a vital source of water. The big 
    question is “where is the water”.<br>
    <br>
    This presentation will show how OpenStreetMap, a SSSI mapathon, an 
    innovative Firewater App, high-resolution imagery, globally volunteered 
    geospatial information, artificial intelligence, and a proactive government 
    can find ‘FireWater’.</p>
  <p><b>Biography:</b>  Dr Lesley Arnold is an independent consultant working 
    with governments to develop strategies, policies and implementation plans 
    for geospatial information reform, open data initiatives and geospatial 
    innovation globally.<br>
    <br>
    Lesley currently works with the United Nations and World Bank supporting 
    countries to strengthen their geospatial information management capabilities 
    towards implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and is one 
    of the lead authors of the UN-GGIM Integrated Geospatial Information Framework. 
    Lesley has held several executive positions on intergovernmental committees, and 
    led Western Australia’s fundamental geospatial information program for many years.   
    She is currently a Board Director for AuScope and SSSI.</p>
    
  <h4>Nathan Woodrow</h4>
  <img src="/img/bios/NathanWoodrow.jpg" style="width:auto; height:auto">
  <p><b>Title:</b> How to Win Friends and Work on Open Source</p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Open source is eating the world, all the cool kids are 
    doing it these days.  What does that mean for your own personal and 
    career growth to be involved in  open source projects? And what of the 
    people involved?  Are your contributions all that matter or is the 
    community an important driver in success</p>
  <p><b>Biography:</b> Nathan is a core QGIS developer and software developer 
    for Chartis Technology. He has been involved as a developer in the QGIS 
    project since 2011 (wow old), but still loves it the same if not more 
    since he has seen it grow into what it is.</p>

  <h4>Markus Mannheim</h4>
  <img src="/img/bios/MarkusMannheim.jpg" style="width:auto; height:auto">
  <p><b>Title:</b> What users want</p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b> News media increasingly understand the importance of 
    interactive story-telling. This is especially the case with data-rich 
    stories — industry research shows audiences are far more engaged with 
    numerical information if it is presented to them visually, and if audiences 
    are allowed to explore it. However, the news industry is amid a financial 
    crisis and increasingly unable to employ developers. At the same time, 
    providers of geodata-visualisation platforms, such as Google and Mapbox, 
    have begun charging substantial fees for high-volume customers like news 
    media. Markus will offer a user-perspective of open-source geodata tools. 
    He will discuss the kinds of visualisation that audiences engage with, 
    the tools that news media are keen to use and some of the barriers to using 
    them.</p>
  <p><b>Biography:</b> Markus Mannheim is a long-time Canberra journalist who has reported 
    on government for 15 years. He now works as a data journalist at the ABC, which employed 
    him as part of its efforts to expand its data analysis and story-telling skills. Markus 
    has studied data analytics but says he is a "journalist who codes a little" rather than 
    a developer.</p>


  <h4>Litea Biukoto</h4>
  <img src="/img/bios/LiteaBiukoto.jpg" style="width:auto; height:auto">
  <p><b>Title:</b> OSS in Disaster Risk Reduction in the Pacific Region</p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Coming Soon</p>
  <p><b>Biography:</b> Litea has been an advocate of Free and Opensource Software 
    and OpenData here in the Pacific and has anchored work develop and launch 
    opendata repository of disaster risk information  - the Pacific Risk Information 
    System. Litea is a technical expert of disaster risk assessments in the region 
    which has her involved in a number of technical expert groups including the 
    Technical Working Group on Disaster Statistics in Asia and Pacific and the 
    Technical Expert Group on Comprehensive Risk Management that reports to the 
    Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage.</p>
